In the previous task, we learned that McSkidy was indeed a victim of a spearphishing campaign that also contained a suspicious-looking document Division_of_labour-Load_share_plan.doc. McSkidy accidentally opened the document, and it's still unknown what this document did in the background. McSkidy has called on the in-house expertÂ Forensic McBlue to examine the malicious document and find the domains it redirects to. Malicious documents may contain a suspicious command to get executed when opened, an embedded malware as a dropper (malware installer component), or may have some C2 domains to connect to.
